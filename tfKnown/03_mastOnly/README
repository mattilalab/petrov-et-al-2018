The script in this folder runs MAST on the genomic regions of interest
searching for TFs identified for each region in Homo sapiens.

Files:

1) matrixRegion/* | This folder should contain PFM, collected at step
   02 for each TF found in H. sapiens.
   
   We have provided here a tarball of our own data, as an example.
   
2) regionPretty/* | This folder should contain sorted sequences by
   their correcponding region in different species. The files are
   generated at step 01. 
   
   We have provided here the regions from our own analyses, extracted
   from the genome assemblies listed in supplementary Table S11.
   
3) trfact.txt | unique region names

4) mastOnly | For each unique genomic region, where a TF was found in
   Homo sapiens (defined in "trfact.txt"), this script runs MAST using
   corresponding PFM (collected in "matrixRegion") to search across
   the sorted genomic regions from different species ("regionPretty").
