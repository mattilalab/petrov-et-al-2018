tfKnown: transcription factors (known) search

This folder contains a collectin of script that were used in our study
(Petrov et al 2018, MANUSCRIPT) to acquire data for transcription
factor binding sequences reported for H. sapiens.

The folders numbers follow the workflow order. Each folder contains a 
more detailed README.

The folders contain the following scripts:
00_batchFromNCBI/
Scripts to download and untar chromosome sequences from listed species
 
01_memePrepKnown/
Script to extract genomic sequences from their coordinates and sort
them by corresponding region for multiple species.

02_extractTFmatrix/
Script to extract position frequency matrix (PFM) for a list of
transcription factors (TF).

03_mastOnly/
A script that runs MAST (meme-suite) on genomic regions of interest
searching for TFs identified for each region in Homo sapiens.

04_mastBestSort/
A script that sorts the hits obtained in step 03 in a table (CSV),
spreadshteet-friendly. Output is: "tableFinal.csv"
