The script in this folder simply sorts the hits obtained in step 03,
preparing a spreadhseet-friendly table of comma separated values (CSV).

Files:

1) mastBest/* | Hits obtained from step 03 per region. This folder is
   empty, however we provided a tarball with our data.

2) regionTF.txt | List of unique TF regions, similar to "trfact.txt",
   but in two columns.

3) speciesSort.txt | List of species (Latin_names), arranged to follow
   the order of the species in the phylogenetic tree in Fig 6.

4) mastBestSort | The script creates a table (CSV) indicating in which
   species each TF was found at step 03. The table generated in our
   analyses is
   
   ../tableFinal.csv
