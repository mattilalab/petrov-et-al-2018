The script in this folder extracts and sorts corresponding genomic
regions from multiple species.

Files:

1) species.txt | List of species (Latin_names) to be considered.

2) bedFiles-uniqueRegions/* | This folder should contain the
   collection of *.bed files with genomic coordinates from each
   species. Use the bed file from Homo sapiens as a start to extract
   the corresponding genomic coordinates for the rest of the species
   by liftOver at UCSC:
  
   URL:  http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgLiftOver
   
   Each genomic region must have a unique name.
   
   IMPORTANT! If you have downloaded the chromosomes with our script
   in 00, then remember that it pulls the latest genomic assembly for
   each chromosome. Therefore, the coordinates in the bed files may
   differ (as they were extracted in August-September 2018). You need
   to get the coordinates between species genomes yourself at the URL
   above. Then prepare a collection of bed files named as the example,
   starting with the latin name of each species:
   
   Homo_sapiens-*.bed

   Here, we have provided a tarball containing the bed files used in
   our study.
   
3) trfact.txt | List of genomic regions to be sorted (same names as
   specified in the bed files).
   
4) memePrepKnown | The script extracts and sorts the corresponding
   genomic regions from the species listed in "species.txt". The out-
   put directory is /tmp/01_memePrepKnown and the sorted sequences
   per region will be in the subfolder "regionPretty". You need this
   for step 03.
