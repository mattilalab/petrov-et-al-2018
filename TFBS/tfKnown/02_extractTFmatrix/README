The script in this folder extracts position frequency matrix (PFM) for
a list of transcription factors (TF) from 4 databases.

Files:

1) trfactors.txt | List of the TF names for which we are going to
   retrieve PFM.
   
2) trfact.txt | Genomic region names, same as the ones in
   ../01_memePrepKnown/trfact.txt
   
3) extractTFmatrix | The script extracts the PFM from 4 databases for
   the TF for each genomic region. It will output in the terminal the
   TF for which there are no PFM available. The results will be in
   
   /tmp/02_extractTFmatrix
   
   The folder with PFM per region is called "matrixRegion". You need
   this for step 03.
