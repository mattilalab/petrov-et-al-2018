Scripts in this folder automate the download of chromosome sequences
from NCBI and their extraction. 

Files:

1) species_chr.txt | List each species (Latin_names) and the chromosome
   to be downloaded next to it. They should be space separated.
   
2) batchFromNCBI | This script reads "species_chr.txt" and downloads
   the chromosome sequence. See the script for locations.
   
3) batchGunzip | This script extracts (gunzips) the chromosomes
   downloaded by batchFromNCBI.

Please NOTE that this will pull the *latest* genomic assembly of each
chromosome and the coordinates extracted between species' genomes may
differ. You *must* prepare updated bed files. If you wish to simply
repeat our analyses, please, refer to supplementary Table S11 for
chromosome number and genome assembly version, then download the files
from ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/ and place them in separate
folders named after each species.

For example, download human chromosome 8 to:
/var/tmp/chromosomes/Homo_sapiens
