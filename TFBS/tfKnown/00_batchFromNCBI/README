Scripts in this folder automate the download of chromosome sequences
from NCBI and their extraction. 

Files:

1) species_chr.txt | List each species (Latin_names) and the chromosome
   to be downloaded next to it. They should be space separated.
   
2) batchFromNCBI | This script reads "species_chr.txt" and downloads
   the chromosome sequence. By default, the script downloads the
   chromosomes in the following location:
   
   /var/tmp/chromosomes
   
   Please NOTE that this will pull the *latest* genomic assembly of
   each chromosome and the coordinates extracted between species
   genomes (by liftOver in step 01) may differ. You *must* prepare
   updated bed files, as explained in ../01_memePrepKnown/README. If
   you wish to simply repeat our analyses, refer to supplementary
   Table S11 for chromosome number and genome assembly version, then
   download the files from
   
   URL:  ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/
   
   and place them in separate folders named after each species. For
   example, download human chromosome 8 to:
   
   /var/tmp/chromosomes/Homo_sapiens

3) batchGunzip | This script extracts (gunzips) the chromosomes
   downloaded by batchFromNCBI.
