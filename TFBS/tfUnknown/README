tfUnknown: transcription factors (unknown) prediction

This folder contains a collectin of script that were used in our study
(Petrov et al 2018, MANUSCRIPT) to acquire data for transcription
factor binding sequences reported for H. sapiens.

The folders' numbers follow the workflow order. Each folder contains a 
more detailed README.

The folders contain the following scripts:
 
01_memePrepUnknown/
Scripts to extract genomic sequences from their coordinates, sort
them by corresponding region for multiple species and generate masked
repeats and background profiles.

02_searchUnknown/
Script to predict novel transcription factors for H. sapiens.

03_mastOnlyUnknown/
A script that runs MAST (from meme-suite) on genomic regions of
interest searching for TFs.

04_mastBestSortUnknown/
A script that sorts the hits obtained in step 03 in a table (CSV),
spreadshteet-friendly. Output is: "tableFinal.csv", found in the same
directory as this README.
