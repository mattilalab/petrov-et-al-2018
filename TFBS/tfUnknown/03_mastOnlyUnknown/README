The script in this folder runs MAST on the genomic regions of interest
searching for TFs identified for each region in Homo sapiens.

Files:

1) matrixRegion/* | This folder should contain PFM, collected at step
   02 for each predicted TF that was found in H. sapiens. 
   
   We have provided here a tarball of our own data, as an example.

2) regionPretty/* | This folder should contain sorted sequences by
   their correcponding region in different species. The files are
   generated at step 01.
   
   We have provided here the regions from our own analyses, extracted
   from the genome assemblies listed in supplementary Table S11.

3) echoreg.txt | This text file should contain defined region, one per
   row. Regions are named after the TFs predicted to be there in step
   02.

4) mastOnlyUnknown | For each unique genomic region, where a TF was
   predicted for Homo sapiens (defined in "echoreg.txt"), this script
   runs MAST using corresponding PFM (collected in "matrixRegion") to
   search across the sorted genomic regions from different species
   ("regionPretty").
