The script in this folder searches for novel transcription factors in
one or more genomic regions.

Files:

1) maskedBackground/* | This folder should contain background Markov
   model files, generated from the genomic regions in "regionPretty"
   with or without masked repeats.
   
   In our study, we selected only one region, which we have left in
   the folder as an example.
   
2) regionMasked/* | This folder should contain the sequences of the
   genomic regions with masked repeats, generated from "regionPretty"
   by RepeatMasker.
   
3) regionPretty/* | This folder contains the sequences of the genomic
   regions to be searched.
   
4) novelTF | This script calls meme, mast and tomotom from the meme-
   suite and searches for novel transcription factor binding sites. It
   will output hits for Homo sapiens. In the next step (03) we search
   these novel TFs identified here for human in the other species.
   Check the script's comments for options and variables.

5) regions.txt | This text file lists the names of the genomic regions
   to be searched.
