The script in this folder extracts and sorts corresponding genomic
regions from multiple species.

Files:

1) species.txt | List of species (Latin_names) to be considered.

2) bedUnknown/* | This folder should contain the collection of *.bed
   files with genomic coordinates from each species. Use the bed file
   from Homo sapiens as a start to extract the corresponding genomic
   coordinates for the rest of the species by liftOver at UCSC:
  
   URL:  http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgLiftOver
   Each genomic region must have a unique name.
   
   IMPORTANT! If you have downloaded the chromosomes with our script
   in ../trKnown/00_batchFromNCBI, then remember that it pulls the
   latest genomic assembly for each chromosome. Therefore, the
   coordinates in the bed files may differ (as they were extracted in
   August-September 2018). You need to get the coordinates between
   species genomes yourself at the URL above.

   Here, we have provided a tarball containing the bed files used in
   our study as an example.
   
3) regions.txt | List of genomic regions to be sorted (same names as
   specified in the bed files). We have selected only one, shown in
   red on Fig 6 of our study and called "SEARCH" in our paper.
   
4) memePrepUnknown | The script extracts and sorts the corresponding
   genomic regions from the species listed in "species.txt". The out-
   put directory is /tmp/01_memePrepUnknown and the sorted sequences
   per region will be in the subfolder "regionPretty". You need this
   for step 02. Run this script first.
   
5) sequenceRepeatMasker | The script uses the sorted sequences by
   memePrepUnknown and masks repeats by calling RepeatMasker. You do
   not need to set up anything, just run it after memePrepUnknown. It
   uses the same folder in /tmp. The output you need for step 02 is
   the subfolders "regionMasked" and "maskedBackground".
